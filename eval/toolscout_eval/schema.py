"""toolscout-eval's OWN report shapes — deliberately NOT in (or imported from) `toolscout.schema`.

The separation is the reward fence: `toolscout.schema` stays score-free (its `TaskOutcome` /
`AssembledOutcome` structurally have no score field), and the eval score lives HERE, in a package the
rollout core never imports. Structurally there is NO composite score and NO reward field anywhere in
these models: `EvalScore` is four independent 0-10 category measurements, `EvalReport`'s aggregate is
per-category MEANS (TF flagged primary, matching ATLAS), never a weighted sum. Composing a single
number out of these is a downstream operator's call — doing it here would turn a measurement into a
training signal.

Pure pydantic; no dspy, no openai, no toolscout import.
